# Coffee Machine Program

Welcome to the Coffee Machine Program! This is a simple text-based program written in Python that simulates a coffee machine.

## Description
This program allows users to choose from a menu of coffee options (espresso, latte, cappuccino) and provides the user with the selected coffee if there are enough resources available. It also handles the payment process, calculating change if necessary, and updating the machine's profit.

## Features
- Menu with three coffee options: espresso, latte, cappuccino.
- Resources management: water, milk, coffee.
- Coin processing: accepts quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
- Transaction handling: calculates change and updates profit.
- Ability to turn the machine on/off and generate a report of resources and profit.

## Usage
1. Run the `coffee_machine.py` file using a Python interpreter.
2. Follow the prompts to select a coffee, insert coins, and receive your drink.
3. Use the "off" command to turn off the machine or "report" to generate a report.

## Explanation of Coding Skills
This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, particularly in the areas of:
- Data structures: dictionaries, lists, and loops.
- Exception handling: ensuring user inputs are valid.
- Modular programming: using functions to organize code.
- Object-oriented programming: encapsulating coffee properties and behaviors.

Feel free to customize this program, add more features, or improve the interface. Have fun brewing coffee with the Coffee Machine Program!
